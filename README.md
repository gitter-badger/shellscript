# About
ShellScript is a shell command runner written in Python.

# Syntax
Basic ShellScript looks like a `.gitignore` file. Simply write the commands you want, each command gets it own line. See [`example.shs`.](https://github.com/shellscript-lang/shellscript/blob/master/example.shs) to runnable shell commands.
