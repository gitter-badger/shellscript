# About
ShellScript is a shell command runner written in Python.

# Syntax
Basic ShellScript looks like a `.gitignore` file. Simply write the commands you want, each command gets it own line. See [`example.shs`.](https://github.com/chikadi/shellscript/blob/master/example.shs)

# Running
You can use ShellScript by creating a `.shs` file and putting your commands in the file. Then, run your file using `shs.run` - for a run configuration, or `shs.py <filename>` - in the terminal.
